## Abstract
The video game industry has undergone a series of changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stress on the supply chains of hardware and software have forced companies to adjust to new working environments within short periods of time. At the same time, people have turned more and more towards games as a form of leisure, entertainment, and human connection. We analyze several economic and human studies data sets collected during the past 2 years in order to visualize the supply, demand, and popularity of games during the pandemic. Our results suggest that despite turbulence in the supply chain, game companies have managed to adequately shift their business models to allow for tremendous growth as other industries have struggled.

由于新冠大流行，电子游戏行业经历了一系列的变化。硬件和软件供应链上的压力迫使公司在短时间内适应新的工作环境。同时，人们越来越多地将游戏作为一种休闲、娱乐和人际关系的形式。本项目分析了过去两年中收集的几个经济和人类研究数据集，以便直观地看到大流行期间游戏的供应、需求和流行情况。数据分析的结果表明，尽管供应链方面出现种种情况，但游戏公司已经设法及时转变了他们的商业模式，以便在其他行业备受挑战的期间实现巨大的增长。

In this project, the visualizations present how regular production process, total consumer spending, user behavior and gaming community network are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As we expected, the video game industry has demonstrated with data that it is unshakable in people's minds and will go farther in the future.

在本项目中，可视化部分呈现了常规生产流程、消费者总支出、用户行为和玩家社区集体是如何受到新冠大流行的影响。正如我们所料，电子游戏行业用数据证明了它在人们心中的地位是不可动摇的，并且在未来会走得更远。
